# Add Scoring to Pong

Enhance the Pong game by adding:
- HTML: Add a `<div id="score">Score: 0</div>` above the canvas to display the score.
- JS: 
  - Initialize a score variable starting at 0.
  - Increment the score when the ball hits the paddle.
  - Update the score display in the DOM each frame.
  - Reset the ball to the center (with random x-direction) when it misses the paddle (hits bottom), without resetting the score.

# Pong Game Initial Setup

Generate a simple Pong game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
- HTML: Basic structure with a canvas element (id="pongCanvas", 800x400px) and a title "Pong Demo".
- CSS: Center the canvas on the page with a black background and white border.
- JS: Use Canvas API to:
  - Draw a white paddle (100px wide, 10px high) at the bottom, movable left/right with arrow keys.
  - Draw a white ball (10px radius) starting at canvas center, moving diagonally with constant speed.
  - Bounce the ball off the top and side walls; reset to center if it hits the bottom (misses paddle).
  - Detect paddle collision to bounce the ball back up.
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation.

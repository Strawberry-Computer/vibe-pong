# Pong Game Initial Setup

Generate a simple Pong game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- Use `<canvas width="800" height="400" id="pongCanvas">` 
- Draw a white paddle (10px wide, 100px high) at the left side of the canvas, movable up/down with arrow keys.
- Draw a white ball (10px radius) starting at canvas center, moving diagonally with constant speed.
- Bounce the ball off the top and side walls; reset to center if it hits the bottom (misses paddle).
- Detect paddle collision to bounce the ball back up.
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation.
